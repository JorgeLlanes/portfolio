            Hello World! My name is Jorge Llanes, located in Austin, Texas. I
            Aspire to be a full-stack software engineer. Everything I do every
            day is aimed at achieving one goal - to fill people's daily lives
            with visual and functional aesthetics. I do both Web-design and
            Development. So the final result always turns out the way I intended
            it. But I also like to work in a team, Where each is a professional
            in their field and does their job perfectly. I am a son of immigrant
            parents from Mexico, My mission is to break barriers in the tech
            industry and bring tech to light in the Latino community ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸.
